A small Belote game for education purposes.

Right now you can play a game with 3 AIs, but the AI will just play valid random cards.

Next step is to implement the AI behavior itself.

FOr it to compile you'll also need the Pebble project ( https://github.com/cvayer/Pebble-Unity ) That you can extract in Assets/Scripts/Pebble.

Pebble is a small framework I've made to reuse some code between projects easily.
